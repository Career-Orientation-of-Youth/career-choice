        <big>Career exploration –</big>With the help of career guidance, you get exposed to a wide range of career opportunities, which further allows you to find the best fit for yourself. A counselor conducts various exploration activities so that you can decide whether the career you want to pursue aligns well with your abilities and skills.</h3>

    <p>
        <h3><b><font  color="white" face="Sitka Heading Semibold"> With increasingly myriad career options rising, career counselling has become an essential part of people's life. Students after completing their 10th are often indecisive of what to do further. This indecisiveness could be a result of social pressure, lack of parental guidance, multiple career options, ignorance of personal potentials etc., career counselors cater to these issues effectively. Although career counselling is vital to all age groups, teenagers can benefit most from it. Besides students, career guidance also caters to employees who have already chosen a career and are not satisfied with it. These individuals are redirected towards their goals and are given insight into their professional orientation.
