        Today, an undergraduate degree provides limited opportunities in terms of pay and employment prospects, prompting many students to follow the path less travelled, i.e. enrol in a professional school. Rather than being a jack of all trades, a professional course/certification allows you to further into a certain industry.</br>

These courses provide students with the correct combination of technical knowledge, skill development components, and industry orientation, preparing them for a specialised profession of their choice.</br>

If you have recently graduated with a bachelor's degree and are seeking professional programmes, here is a thorough list of some of the most popular professional courses after graduation.</br>
    </big></p>
    <h1  style="background-color: rgb(17, 78, 103);"align="center"><font size="6" color="white" face="eras demi itc" ><u>What are Professional Courses?</u></font></h1>
    <p><big>
        Professional Courses imply teaching students industry-specific skills. A professional course gives students hands-on experience. After completing the course, students are job-ready.</br>

In contrast, a degree course aims to provide students with a solid academic foundation and expertise in a certain area. The focus of these courses is on skill development, professional advancement, and self-improvement.</br>

This offers the students an advantage over their peers while also encouraging innovation. Professional courses instil in pupils the necessary soft skills that are in high demand in the market.</br>
